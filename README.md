WordPress Cleanup and Basic Options Functions is a utility plugin, even though it's was developed with a  focus on developers as many functionalities are what you might just add to every new website you build, it's really easy to use, just check the boxes corresponding to the set up you want.
It will help you:

*    Cleanup your website head and also some markup included with shortcodes section.
*    Prettify the search url, ex: http://yourwebsite.com/search/search-terms.
*    Load jQuery from Google CDN(default) or form your chosen cdn provider instead of using the hosted version.
*    Change the p to figure tag to surround your images.
*    Add Retina support for your images.
*    Add additional images sizes and modify those.
*    Setup a Logo and background color for your login page
